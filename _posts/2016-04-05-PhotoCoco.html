<p>The original problem statement was given here: http://www.datasciencecentral.com/forum/topics/challenge-of-the-week-identifying-patterns-in-complex-time-series</p>

<p>There was also a verbal solution given in the members only section. I'm not sure if its legal to share the whole thing, but here is an excerpt of the solution. " The time series has a weekly periodicity with two peaks: Monday and Thursday, corresponding respectively to the publication of the Monday and Thursday digests. The impact of the Monday and Thursday email blasts extent over the next day; this makes measuring the yield more difficult, unless you use additional data, e.g. from our newsletter vendor. However, the bulk of the impact is really on Monday and Thursday."</p>

<p>There are a variety of signal processing techniques that can be applied to time series data. For example, trend components can be extracted from a time series by transforming the signal into the frequency domain, filtering out non dominant frequencies, and then recombining the signal. This tends to work well for finding the overall trend, but it violates the assumption that the signal is a stationary process. In addition, this method is limited to the shapes that the sum of orthogonal sinusoids can make. This paper considers another approach where dominant frequencies are extracted, but where the signals are recombined in a linear model. In this linear model, the seasonality of the time series can be accounted by including a set of orthogonal sinusoidal waves, different frequencies, and different time components. However, finding the appropriate frequency and time component for each sinusoid requires a little more digging. This paper shows how to use Discrete Fourier transforms to automatically find these values.</p>

<h3>Signal Processing Basics</h3>

<p><img src='/ts_challenge_images/n_point_DFT.tiff' /></p>

<ul>
<li>k ? [0,N-1] or k ? [?N/2, N/2?1] or k ? [?(N?1)/2, (N?1)/2]</li>
<li>N = # of data points</li>
<li>n = rank order of input data points</li>
<li>k = rank order of output data points</li>
</ul>

<h3>Assumptions</h3>

<p>"The Fourier transform assumes that the signal is stationary and that the signals in the sample continue into infinity. The Fourier transform performs poorly when this is not the case."</p>

<p>A stationary process has a constant mean and variance over time which is a property that most time series don't have. A stationary process can be extracted from the time series by creating a time differenced variable. However, the complex magnitudes from the time difference variable does not represent the actual signal. A regression model can then be used to recontruct the magnitudes of this signal.</p>
